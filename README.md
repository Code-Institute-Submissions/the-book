<h1>The Book - Online Cookbook App Milestone Project 3</h1>
<hr>

<p>This project is the culmination of the material covered in the data-centric development module from the Code Institute. Given the brief of an online cookbook app, I decided to create a website where users could view recipes from around the world and act as a recipe database, also allowing for users to add their own creations to share with others.</p>

<h2>UX </h2>
</hr>

<p>This site was designed to allow users to view, edit and add new recipes. The recipes are grouped by name. It is also possible to find recipes that exclude a specific allergen.</p>

<h4>User Stories</h4>
<ul>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to add, edit and/or delete recipes that I have created and shared.</li>
    <li>As a user with specific dietary requirements, I want to be able to search for recipes which exclude the things I am allergic to.</li>
    <li>As an aspiring cook, I want to be able to search for recipes that require different levels of skill.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to view different recipes to get ideas for meals to cook for a party/friends/family.</li>
</ul>

<h4>User Login and Registration</h4>

<ul>
    <li>A user can create an account and have their own unique username. This username will be used to log in and identify a recipe belonging to that user.</li>
    <li>The Log In page is the first page all users visiting the website will see. It contains a jumbotron with some information and directions for the user.</li>
</ul>
